Project Title: "Word Frequency Analyzer"

Project Description:
The "Word Frequency Analyzer" is a command-line tool that takes a text file as input and analyzes the frequency of each word in the file. It provides insights into the most commonly used words and helps users gain a better understanding of the text's content.

Features:

Read a text file from the user.
Analyze the frequency of each word in the file.
Display the top N most frequently used words.
Provide a summary of the analysis.
Project Implementation:

User Input:

Prompt the user to enter the path of the text file to be analyzed.
Read the input from the user.
File Reading:

Open the text file specified by the user.
Read the contents of the file.
Word Frequency Analysis:

Split the text into individual words.
Create an empty hash to store word frequencies.
Iterate over each word:
If the word already exists in the hash, increment its count.
If the word is new, add it to the hash with a count of 1.
Top N Words:

Prompt the user to enter the number of top words to display.
Read the input from the user.
Sort the hash of word frequencies in descending order based on the counts.
Display the top N words along with their frequencies.
Analysis Summary:

Calculate the total number of words in the text.
Calculate the unique number of words in the text.
Calculate the average frequency of words.
Display the analysis summary.


Certainly! I can help you generate a complete beginner-level project in Ruby based on the data you have provided. Here's a project idea that incorporates the concepts we discussed:

Explanation:

The program prompts the user to enter the path of the text file to be analyzed.
The text file is read and its contents are stored in the text variable.
The word_counts hash is created to store word frequencies.
The text is split into individual words, and each word is iterated over.
If the word already exists in the word_counts hash, its count is incremented.
If the word is new, it is added to the hash with a count of 1.
The user is prompted to enter the number of top words to display.
The word_counts hash is sorted in descending order based on the counts, and the top N words are extracted.
Analysis summary is calculated, including the total number of words, unique words, and average frequency.
The results are displayed, including the analysis summary and the top N words.
This project provides a basic word frequency analysis tool that you can enhance and customize further based on your needs. You can expand the functionality by adding options to exclude common words, visualize the results using graphs or charts, or even build a graphical user interface (GUI) for the tool.
